// Taco Truck
// Joe drives a taco truck in the booming town of Squaresburg. He uses an array of [x,y] coordinates corresponding to locations of his customers. They walk to his truck, but he is fair-minded so he wants to minimize total distance from truck to customers. City blocks are perfect squares, and every street is two-way, at perfect right angles. He only parks by stree corners (coordinates like [37,-16]). Customers only travel on streets: coordinate [2,-2] is distance 4 from [0,0]. Joe checks the array before deciding where to park. Given a customer coordinate array, return an optimal taco truck location.
// Example: given [[10,0],[-1,-10],[2,4]] return [2,0], as total distance is 25 (8+13+4) which is the shortest possible combined distance for all customers.

    let mindistance = 100;
    for (let row = -10; row <= 10; row++){
        for (let col = -10; col <= 10; col++)
        {
            let d1 = Math.abs(customers[0][0] - row) + Math.abs(customers[0][1] - col) 
            let d2 = Math.abs(customers[1][0] - row) + Math.abs(customers[1][1] - col)
            let d3 = Math.abs(customers[2][0] - row) + Math.abs(customers[2][1] - col)
            let distance = d1 + d2 + d3 
            if (distance<mindistance){
                mindistance = distance
                location = [row, col]
            }
